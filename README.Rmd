This is an implementation of the `largeVis` algorithm described in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00370).  It also incorporates:

*	A very fast algorithm for estimating k-nearest neighbors, implemented in C++ with `Rcpp` and `OpenMP`.
* An efficient implementation of the `HDBSCAN` algorithm for unsupervised clustering, which leverages the nearest neighbor data genereated by `largeVis`. 
* Functions for visualizing manifolds like [this](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cnnembed/).

### News Highlights

* Version 0.1.9.1 has been accepted by CRAN. Much grattitude to Uwe Ligges and Kurt Hornik for their assistance, advice, and patience. 
* I am working on restoring the OPTICS and DBSCAN implementations that were removed from version 0.1.9 for CRAN submission. If you would like to experiment with these, check branch `features/opticsanddbscan`. 
* Anyone watching closely will have noticed that the git branches had become something of a mess.  I have moved to git flow in an attempt to restore some sort of sanity.  There may still be some inconsistencies in the git over the next few days. I am working on it. 

#### Building Notes

* The CRAN binaries are likely to have been compiled with 32-bit ARMA objects, and without OpenMP on OS X. 
* To get 64-bit ARMA objects, add to `~.R/Makevars`:
```
R_XTRA_CXXFLAGS = -DARMA_64BIT_WORD
```
and recompile from source. (`devtools::install_github("elbamos/largeVis")` will work). 

* Getting OpenMP support on OS X is a bit tricky. What I've done, is to install `llvm` (version 3.8 or later), and then add the following to `~.R/Makevars`:
```
SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS = -fopenmp
R_XTRA_CXXFLAGS = -DARMA_64BIT_WORD
LDFLAGS =  ""-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
CPPFLAGS =  -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include
PATH = /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH 
```
	- Recompile from source, as above.
